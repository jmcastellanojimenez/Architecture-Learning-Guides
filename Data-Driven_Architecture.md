## Architecture Foundation

### The Data-Driven Ecosystem

Modern systems exist within a complex ecosystem where data flows continuously from sources to insights:

**Data Sources → Ingestion → Processing → Storage → Analytics → Actions**

This linear view oversimplifies reality. Modern architectures are networks where:
- Data flows bidirectionally
- Systems self-monitor and self-heal
- AI models provide feedback loops
- Edge devices make autonomous decisions

### Core Architectural Patterns

#### Lambda Architecture
**Concept:** Separate processing paths for real-time (speed layer) and batch (batch layer) data, merged in a serving layer.

**When to Use:**
- Guaranteed accuracy requirements
- Complex analytics requiring complete datasets
- Regulatory compliance needing audit trails
- Organizations with existing batch processing investments

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Guaranteed accuracy through batch reconciliation
- ✅ Handles both real-time and historical processing
- ❌ Increased complexity and maintenance overhead
- ❌ Duplicate code between speed and batch layers

#### Kappa Architecture
**Concept:** Single stream processing pipeline handles all data, with reprocessing through stream replay.

**When to Use:**
- Operational simplicity priorities
- Modern stream processing capabilities available
- Faster time-to-market requirements
- Organizations building greenfield systems

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simplified architecture and maintenance
- ✅ Single codebase for all processing
- ❌ Requires sophisticated stream processing frameworks
- ❌ Potential accuracy compromises in edge cases

### Design Principles

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**Core Concepts:**
- **Bounded Contexts:** Clear boundaries between different business domains
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Shared vocabulary between technical and business teams
- **Aggregates:** Consistency boundaries for data modifications
- **Domain Services:** Business logic that doesn't belong to specific entities

**Application in Data Architecture:**
```
Device Management Domain
├── Device Registry Service
├── Device Health Monitoring
└── Firmware Update Management

Analytics Domain
├── Real-time Metrics Service
├── Customer Behavior Analysis
└── Predictive Analytics Engine

Operations Domain
├── Infrastructure Monitoring
├── Alert Management
└── Capacity Planning
```

#### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
**Core Concepts:**
- **Ports:** Define interfaces for external interactions
- **Adapters:** Implement specific technologies (databases, message queues, APIs)
- **Core Domain:** Business logic isolated from external concerns

**Benefits for Data Systems:**
- Technology independence allows switching from Kafka to Pulsar
- Testability through mock adapters
- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure

## Implementation Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

#### Event Sourcing
**Concept:** Store all changes as events, derive current state through replay

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail
- Time-travel debugging
- Event replay for new projections

**Implementation with Kafka:**
```java
@EventHandler
public void handle(DeviceActivatedEvent event) {
    // Store event in Kafka topic
    eventStore.append("device-events", event);
    
    // Update read model
    deviceProjection.activate(event.getDeviceId());
}
```

#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**Concept:** Separate models for reading and writing data

**Application in Data Systems:**
- **Command Side:** Stream processing, data ingestion
- **Query Side:** Time-series databases, analytical stores

#### Saga Pattern
**Concept:** Manage distributed transactions through choreography or orchestration

**Use Case:** Multi-step data processing workflows

### Data Pipeline Patterns

#### Change Data Capture (CDC)
**Tools:**
- **Debezium:** Kafka Connect-based CDC
- **AWS DMS:** Managed CDC service
- **Maxwell:** MySQL binlog streaming

**Pattern:**
```
Database → CDC Connector → Kafka → Stream Processor → Target Store
```

#### Lambda Architecture Implementation
```
Data Source
    ├── Speed Layer (Kafka Streams) → Real-time View
    ├── Batch Layer (Spark) → Batch View
    └── Serving Layer (Redis/Cassandra) → Merged View
```

#### Kappa Architecture Implementation
```
Data Source → Kafka → Stream Processor → Materialized View
                ↑                              ↓
                └─── Replay for Reprocessing ──┘
```

### Microservices Patterns for Data Systems

#### Service per Database
Each microservice owns its data and database schema.

#### Database per Service
Avoid shared databases between services.

#### Transactional Outbox
Ensure consistency between database updates and event publishing.

#### API Gateway
Centralize cross-cutting concerns (authentication, rate limiting, monitoring).

### Troubleshooting and Operations Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Kafka Performance Problems**
```bash
# Check consumer lag
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --describe --group my-group

# Monitor broker metrics
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --describe --topic my-topic

# Optimize producer configuration
properties.put("batch.size", 16384);
properties.put("linger.ms", 5);
properties.put("compression.type", "snappy");
```

**Kubernetes Resource Issues**
```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n data-platform

# Describe resource limits
kubectl describe pod kafka-0 -n data-platform

# Scale StatefulSet
kubectl scale statefulset kafka --replicas=5 -n data-platform
```

**Time-Series Database Optimization**
```sql
-- InfluxDB retention policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "one_week" ON "sensors" 
  DURATION 7d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT;

-- TimescaleDB compression
SELECT add_compression_policy('sensor_data', INTERVAL '7 days');
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting Playbooks

**Kafka Alerts**
```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
- name: kafka
  rules:
  - alert: KafkaConsumerLag
    expr: kafka_consumer_lag_sum > 10000
    for: 5m
    annotations:
      summary: "High consumer lag detected"
      
  - alert: KafkaBrokerDown
    expr: up{job="kafka"} == 0
    for: 1m
    annotations:
      summary: "Kafka broker is down"
```

**Application Health Checks**
```java
@Component
public class KafkaHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
    @Override
    public Health health() {
        try {
            // Check Kafka connectivity
            adminClient.listTopics().names().get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            return Health.up().build();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return Health.down(e).build();
        }
    }
}
```
